Simulations were realized using n_rw=1000 . 
Sequences had length = 10000 and alphabet=['A', 'C', 'G', 'T'] of length A=4
Were implemented 3 different values of replication rate f=[1,3,10]
Results presented: for each t, average of the n_rw values is shown

The simualation of m used the exact same values. This is just a single realization.
